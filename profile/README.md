## *A. abstract*
As the culture of collecting expensive designer, luxury
and limited-edition sneakers grows among the MZ generation –
Millennials and Gen Z – LG’s internal research found that these
‘sneakerheads’ would benefit greatly from a solution that not only
made their cherished shoes stand out more, but also provided them
with the optimal care. So LG has launched the LG Styler ShoeCase,
which not only optimizes shoe management but also increases the
value of collection and provides LG ThinQ applications to connect
its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers with
a better experience. So our team thought that it would be good
to virtualize the ShoeCase and manage it on this project. NFT
sneakers that exist only virtually are collected as if it were stored
in a LG Styler ShoeCase with MetaKicks project. In addition, the
limited edition of the shoe resell market has grown a lot, and we
decided to create this service to check the resale market price of
shoes in real time. Finally, we thought that the culture of collecting
shoes could be further activated by taking out the shoe case that
was only in my room on the web and creating a culture to share
each other’s shoes collections.

Shoe cases so far are made of plastic and can only function
as storage and display shoes. But The LG Styler ShoeCase
creates the ideal environment for storing shoes by protecting
against humidity and fabric-discoloring UV light, the Styler
ShoeCase represents a great way for shoe enthusiasts to showoff their favorite pairs, offering interior features such as a 360-
degree rotating turntable to increase the value as a collection
rather than just shoes. NFT shoes are stored online, and real
shoes are stored only in the ShoeCase and managed separately.
By using this, these two collections are managed by one app.
We thought it would be good to share the collection, including
NFT shoes, with various people to further boost the shoe
collection culture. So we make this service by paying attention
to the value of the collection. It check the fluctuating resell
market price in real time using Kream or StockX’s API, Korea
and USA’s leading sneakers trade site, and sharing each other’s
collections through this service
